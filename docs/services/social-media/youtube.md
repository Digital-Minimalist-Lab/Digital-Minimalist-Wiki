## Browser Extensions

:::tip

If you don't know where to start or just want a step by step process look through the [actionable steps](#actionable-steps) section for browser extensions.

If you use a browser to access Youtube there are a number of extensions you can use to remove the attention economy.

### Unhook

Unhook is an extension used for removing many features from Youtube specifically. It can be used to remove the home and subscription feeds so that when you open Youtube you can treat it as a search engine for information in video form instead of a conveyor belt of content to consume.
Unhook can also be used to hide shorts however while hiding them visually it does not stop audio playback.
There are many additional things Unhook can block or remove.

### Uninternet

Uninternet is an extension that does much the same thing as Unhook with no granularity in customizations. It also supports Amazon and Instagram.

### Leechblock

Leechblock allows you to fully block a site on a schedule or apply a visual filter to the site during a schedule. It also allows you to set up a password that is required in order to change block settings.

### Undistracted

Undistracted can block Youtube outright, hide recommendations, redirect to subscription feed, hide breaking news, hide sidebar, hide comments, hide shorts, and hide up next suggestions. It also supports removing features for Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Netflix, LinkedIn, and Instagram. One downside is that it has some premium features and the UI does not support dark mode.

### Ublock Origin

:::warning

Ublock Origin blocks ads although this improves the experience drastically, some creators on and off Youtube rely on ads to make ends meet.

:::

Ublock Origin removes ads on most websites, for Chrome and most other Chromium based browsers ( Edge, Opera, & Vivaldi ) you will require [Ublock Origin Lite](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh).

### SponsorBlock

:::warning

SponsorBlock like Ublock Origin hurts creators however it may also reduce your media literacy as you will likely miss who is funding the information you are taking in.

:::

SponsorBlock allows you to skip sponsors manually or automatically, while also supporting skipping other types of content such as self promotion content.

### Actionable Steps

1. **Choose an extension**. Unhook is great and has everything you need to change the UI of Youtube to be less attention sucking. You can also use [Uninternet](#uninternet) for a one toggle solution and can skip steps 2 and 3.
2. **Turn on all the options**. Turn on all the options unhook provides except the following: _Hide Video Info_; _Hide Top Header_, excluding its sub-option _Hide Notifications_; and _Hide Comments_.
3. **Test for a few days** see what works what doesn't and adjust accordingly.
4. **Turn off your watch history or signout of your google account** (Optional). The reasoning for turning off watch is so that Youtube restricts some addictive features, like the homepage and shorts.

## Alternative Front-ends

| Client                      | Website                                   | Source Code                                         |

| [Freetube](#freetube)       | [freetubeapp.io](https://freetubeapp.io/) | [Github](https://github.com/FreeTubeApp/FreeTube)   |
| [Vacuum Tube](#vacuum-tube) |                                           | [VacuumTube](https://github.com/shy1132/VacuumTube) |

### Freetube

:::warning

Watching via Freetube and other alternative clients, like it, may be blocked when Youtube puts measures in place that disrupt yt-dlp, a tool for downloading online video.
Freetube doesn't support using a google account so you cannot watch members-only content.

:::

Freetube is a desktop application that supports Linux, MacOS, and Windows. It has a massive amount of control over the features you want to block or use. It has built in support for [SponsorBlock](#sponsorblock). It also supports passwords for settings access in addition to some parental controls. Freetube has many more features for limiting distraction not listed here.

#### Actionable steps

1. **Go to the [Freetube website download section](https://freetubeapp.io/#download)**
2. **Choose a version**. For windows users you most likely need the .exe (x64) version.
3. **Install Freetube**.
4. **Export your Youtube subscription data**. Go to this [Google page](https://takeout.google.com/takeout/custom/youtube) to export your Youtube data.
5. **Import your Subscriptions**. In the sidebar go to Settings -> Data -> Import Subscriptions. Navigate to the extracted files you got from step 4 select the subscription file and import it, note there may be multiple files depending on how many people you are subscribed to.
6. **Turn on Distraction Free Settings**. If you are not still in the settings navigate back to the settings screen. Navigate to the section titled Distraction Free and turn on the following settings:
   - _Hide Trending Videos_,
   - _Hide Popular Videos_,
   - _Hide Subscription Shorts_,
   - _Hide Channel "Shorts" Tab_,
   - _Hide Recommended Videos_,
   - _Hide Profile Pictures in Comments_,
   - _Hide Live streams_,

7. **Turn on _Hide on Watch_** While in the settings, navigate to the section titled _Subscriptions_ and turn on the setting _Hide Videos on Watch_.
8. **Test for a few days** see what works what doesn't and adjust accordingly.

### Vacuum Tube

Vacuum Tube is a wrapper of the Youtube tv app but for desktop it has a few features of interest to a digital minimalist like hiding shorts and DeArrow which replaces clickbait thumbnails with less clickbait ones. It also supports custom css which could be used to remove more elements.

#### Actionable steps

1. **Go to the [install section](https://github.com/shy1132/VacuumTube?tab=readme-ov-file#installing) of the README**.
2. **Choose an installer**. For windows users you should use your first option.
3. **Install VacuumTube**. On Windows you may need to let it through your antivirus as it isn't signed.
4. **Sign into VacuumTube**. You should sign into **VacuumTube** with your Google Account so that you can turn off watch history and disable the home feed.
5. **Configure VacuumTube**. Open the settings in the bottom left corner and turn on the following settings: _DeArrow_, _Hide Shorts_, and _Pause Watch history_. Turn off the following settings: _Auto-play next video_.
