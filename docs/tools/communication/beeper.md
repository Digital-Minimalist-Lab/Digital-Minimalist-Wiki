One common problem that drags people back into one social media app or another is the inclusion of direct messages (DMs). DMs are a common way that people keep in touch with one another, to the point that "What's your Instagram" may as well be the new "What's your number?"

Of course, when you consider the mechanisms put in place to redirect attention from an app's DMs to the black hole that is an infinite scroll feed, using social media DMs can quickly turn risky. Will you stay strong, or is that Instagram message from a close friend going to lead to another three hours of scrolling? Conversely, the advent of losing touch when you delete a social media application can quickly turn to anxiety and a risk of reinstalling.

Sounds like you're damned if you do, damned if you don't, right?

If that's the case, it's time to rethink the rules of the game to begin with. If we could just isolate the DMs from the, well, everything else about social media, we could avoid many of the pitfalls that cause us to burn hours on a feed that gives little in return.

That's exactly what Beeper does.
